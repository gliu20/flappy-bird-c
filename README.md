Game Name: Flappy Bird

How to play: Run the program on a DE1-SoC board where a VGA screen and a PS/2 keyboard are connected. 
If you don't have access to a DE1-SoC board, you can instead use CPUlator (https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc), an online simulator of a computer system. (This is designed to be ran on an actual De1-Soc board so it'll be very slow on CPUlatpr.)
Press the enter key to start the game. You can let the bird jump by pressing the space key.
Once the bird hits a pipe or a boundary of the screen, the game is over. You can press the enter
key to play again (this will keep the best score) or press the backspace key (this will reset the
best score) to go back to the menu screen.
